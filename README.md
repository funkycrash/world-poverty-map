# World Poverty Gap ($1.90/day) Per Country Through Time

I worked on poverty data and created a visualization of the evolution of Poverty ($1.90/day definition) per country.

I could get a [dataset](http://data.worldbank.org/topic/poverty) from the World Bank that I used to generate this map. 
I used the [d3.js](https://d3js.org) library that I highly recommend for this kind of visualization and I'm sharing this work so you can have a quick idea of what's possible with this framework.
